# What a Pro can expect

If you've upgraded to pro, or if you're curious, then thank you and here's the skinny.

## What does a Pro account get you?

The Pro user status does two important things:

1. Access to pro features (duh, obviously)
2. Helps sustain JS Bin as a project so it can continue to be free and open source for education

This second point is *really* important to us. JS Bin has existed for over 5 years with no income, running on hefty servers and thousands of development hours poured into it simply because knowing it was being used to teach others was motivation enough.

Eventually we decided that to spend full time on JS Bin, and to invest fully in it's infrastructure, JS Bin needed to sustain itself, hence Pro status.

If you don't want (or need) Pro, but you want to support the project, maybe [donate via Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/jsbin/) instead?

## Pro features

At time of writing, our pro feature set is:

- [Private bins](#privatebins)
- [Vanity URLs](#vanityurls)
- [Asset uploads](#assetuploads)
- [SSL embeds](#sslembeds)
- [Dropbox integration](#dropbox)
- [Priority support](#prioritysupport)
- ["Sandbox" mode](#sandboxmode)
- [Coming next](#comingnext)

And you can [upgrade today](/account/upgrade/pay)!

## Private bins

![Making a bin private](/images/private-menu.png)

Self explanatory, but it means if any other user than you tries to access your private bin, they will get a 404.

Once your bin is private, you'll also see the card in the bottom right indicating it's privacy mode.

## Asset uploads

Just simply drag and drop images you need to use *into* the HTML, and JS Bin will upload and generate the `img` tag for you with the URL prefilled in.

Previously uploaded assets can be managed through the [assets](/account/assets) account page.

## Vanity URLs

Vanity URLs has two purposes. The first is that puts *your* username when you share your bin's output, and secondly allows you to publish to your vanity homepage.

This means you can publish any bin to your vanity url on `<you>.jsbin.com` for example: [http://dave.jsbin.com](http://dave.jsbin.com)

In addition, when you share the full output of your bins, your username is included in the URL, such as [http://dave.jsbin.com/fajac/3/](http://dave.jsbin.com/fajac/3/)

## SSL embeds

![SSL URLs in JS Bin](/images/twdtw/11/ssl.png)

[SSL](/help/ssl) can be turned on for all of JS Bin through the [preferences](/account/preferences) and once enabled, all your bins will be served under SSL, in addition, your [embeds](/help/how-can-i-embed-jsbin) can also be served over SSL.

## Dropbox

Linking to your Dropbox account [from your profile](/account/profile) will put every bin as a full HTML file in your Dropbox `Apps/jsbin` directory. This means you have a complete offline backup of your bins or any bin you edit.

Note that only the latest revision is saved to your Dropbox (though we're considering adding support for revisions).

Finally, *two way* syncing is being investigated and will be released to Pro users if possible.

## Priority support

We manage all our support [through github](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues) but as a Pro user, you will be able to email directly (or chat via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/jsbin/jsbin)). Be sure to notify us of your username and we'll be sure to help.

## "Sandbox" mode

JS Bin is different from other pastebins in that it saves by default *automatically*. This means you'll never lose your work. However, sometimes you want to throw open JS Bin and test some code without JS Bin ever knowing you were there. This is "sandbox" mode.

The URL is simply "slash-dash": [http://jsbin.com/-](http://jsbin.com/-)

JS Bin runs as it normally does, but doesn't save. If you want to save, just use the [keyboard shortcut](/help/keyboard-shortcuts) <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>

## Coming next

As development continues, the following Pro features are next in our roadmap:

* Read and write API access
* Sass/SCSS external @imports
